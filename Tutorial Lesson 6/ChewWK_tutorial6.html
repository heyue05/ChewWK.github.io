My favorite game character is <i><b>Shinyou Inugami</b></i> from <b><i>Onmyoji</i><b>.
His handsome appearance with a touch of cuteness really draws me in. 
He is a <em>cheerful wanderer</em> who values ​​friendship and has a strong sense of justice. 
At the same time, he is also a loyal, gentle and responsible <i>shikigami.</i>
<b>Shinyou Inugami</b> is the Special (SP) version of the Super Rare (SR) character <i><b>Inugami</b></i>.

<p>

<b>Inugami</b> appears in the game as a <i>guardian yokai</i>. 
He was once a stray dog ​​adopted by humans, and turned into a <i>yokai</i> after his beloved owner died. 
Despite this, he remains loyal and kind to humans.

<br><br>

In the plot, <b>Inugami</b> is initially hostile to the player, mistakenly believing that the player is responsible for the death of his best friend. 
However, with the player's help, Inugami discovers the real culprit and resolves the misunderstanding. 
The player even turns Inugami's deceased friend into a guardian spirit to continue accompanying him. 
Deeply moved, Inugami calls the player “<i>Shinyou</i>” (meaning “True Friend”) and vows to follow and protect them as a fighting partner.

<p>

<b>Shinyou Inugami</b> is a new form that represents <em>Inugami’s emotional growth</em>. 
He was officially introduced during the <b><i>Onmyoji 8th Anniversary Celebration</i></b>.

<br><br>

In the event plot, the <b><i>Onmyoji Seimei</i></b> (the player) <u>left the courtyard for a long time</u> (symbolizing a player who left the game). 
During this time, <b>Shinyou Inugami</b> wanders the world and discovers a realm called the “Real World.” Among many “players,” he finds <b>Seimei</b> again.

<br><br>

<b>Shinyou Inugami</b>, with <b>Seimei</b> who has lost all memories of being an <b>Onmyoji</b>, embarks on a journey to reunite with their old friends. 
In the end, <b>Seimei</b> regains his memories, and they all return together to the familiar courtyard.
