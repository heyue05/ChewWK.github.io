A <b><em><big>shepherd</big></em></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest.
He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.

</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">

One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"
Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.

</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">

The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here".
<b><em><big>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</big></em></b>

</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, 
a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</strike>"

</p>

<p>

<span style="color: #800080;"><big>The farmers <sup><small>thought</small></sup> the boy was playing <sub><small>mischief</small></sub> again.</big></span> So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
